## My process

I have built this challenge by using the mobile first design pattern and I countered easier doing it this way since I didn't need to add many changes in the @media for the desktop view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I didn't learn anything new on this project but I like the idea of practice while building real components and doing the best to replicate it as much as possible with my own skills
